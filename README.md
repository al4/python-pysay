# python-pysay

This is a tutorial repository, containing the finished project for a tutorial article I wrote. The code is not much use on its own, it is just an example of how to package python applications for Debian with setuptools and stdeb.

You can find the tutorial [here](https://blog.al4.co.nz/2016/09/building-packaging-command-line-tool-debian).
